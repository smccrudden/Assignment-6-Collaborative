When running the executable the user will be prompted to input an option which will be used allow the user to interact with the program and perform actions such as load an inventory, delete a book, save the inventory, print it to the screen or search for a part of a book name
The files needed to run this are: main.cpp, book.h, books.h, books.cpp.
README contains brief documentation of every file.
